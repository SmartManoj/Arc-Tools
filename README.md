LLMs should code like this to verify it's solutions. I am focusing on completing the 120 evaluation tasks first before creating a Kaggle solution, so that LLM labs can use this fully to train their next models.

Setup instructions:
`pip install -e .`

Run tests:
`pytest`

Run tasks:
`python task_<task_number>.py`
